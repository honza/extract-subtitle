extract-subtitle
================

Many video files come with embedded subtitles, and many video players can't
access those.  This tiny utility extracts the subtitle from the video file into
a separate subtitle file which is much more widely supported.

## Dependencies

Golang, and ffmpeg

## Install

```
$ go get github.com/honza/extract-subtitle
